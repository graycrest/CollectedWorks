# CollectedWorks

A collection of "browser games"


- Button Mania
The bestest button game ever. You will hate it like it goes out of style.


- Codebreaker
A classical "find the code" with some clues. No guessing here, pure logic.


- Foggy Bay
One of the many variations of the mark the bombs and do not click on them game.
This one is, obviously, the best of those.


- Slider
A sliding-type puzzle game to bring order from chaos
(PWA, can be installed)
